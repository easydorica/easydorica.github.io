Rabdomyzer is an in-house tools developed for the interpretation of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (InDels) and the visualization of NGS results.
Variants can be filtered according to sequence ontology, allele frequency and the assumed inheritance pattern defined in the model file. For more information see the [Rabdomyzer](https://git.aosp.biodec.com/genetica-medica/rabdomyzer/-/wikis/home) software documentation.

## Outcomes

The Rabdomyzer workflow generates for each proband listed in the model file:
- a text-format file containing the heterozygous variants,
- a text-format file containing the homozygous variants,
- a text format file containing the compound heterozygous variants (if the model provided is compatible),
- an excel file combining all previous textual outputs.
